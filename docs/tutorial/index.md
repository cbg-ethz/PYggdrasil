# Tutorials

We'd love to see you built upon PYggdrasil. Below we provide some tutorials to help you get started.

## Functional Usage
The below tutorials illustrate how to use PYggdrasil functions for specific tasks.

- [Single MCMC Run](singleMCMC.md) demonstrated how to run a single MCMC chain.
- [Tree Similarities and Visualization](similarities.md) demonstrated how to compute distances between two trees and visualize trees.
- [Analyzing MCMC Runs](analyzeMCMC.md) demonstrated how to compute distances between of MCMC chains and diagnose convergence issues.


## Experimental Workflows
The below tutorials illustrate _snakemake_ workflows ilustrated that allow to run fully reproducible experiments using PYggdrasil.
From tree and data generation to convergence diagostics a pipline exists.

- [Basic Workflow](basic_workflow.md) demonstrated how to run a basic workflow for a particular output file.
- [Advanced Workflow](advanced_workflow.md) demonstrated how to run a more advanced workflow.
