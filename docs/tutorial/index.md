# Tutorials

We'd love to see you built upon PYggdrasil. Below, we provide some tutorials to help you get started.

## Functional Usage
The tutorials below illustrate how to use PYggdrasil functions for specific tasks.

- [Single MCMC Run](singleMCMC.md) demonstrates how to run a single MCMC chain.
- [Tree Similarities and Visualization](similarities.md) demonstrates how to compute distances between two trees and visualize trees.
- [Analyzing MCMC Runs](analyzeMCMC.md) demonstrates how to compute distances between MCMC chains and diagnose convergence issues.


## Experimental Workflows
We use _snakemake_ to create a sustainable and reproducible workflow for extensive experiments with PYggdrasil.
See [Workflows](../workflows/index.md) for more details.

The tutorials below illustrate _snakemake_ workflows that allow running such fully reproducible experiments using PYggdrasil.
From tree and data generation to convergence diagnostics, a pipeline exists.

- [Basic Workflow](basicWorkflows.md) demonstrates a basic workflow for a particular output file.
- [Advanced Workflow](advanced_workflow.md) demonstrates how to run a more advanced workflow.
