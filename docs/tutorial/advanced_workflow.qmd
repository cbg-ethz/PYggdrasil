As part of my thesis at ETH ZÃ¼rich I, [gordonkoehn](https://github.com/gordonkoehn), designed a series of advanced [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) workflows as reproducible experiments. 

We investigated particular aspects of SCITE's MCMC inference:

* _warm-up_ of the MCMC chain
* _multimodal_ posterior distributions
* _convergence diagnsotics_ in the mutation tree space

The workflows are available in:

* _mark01_ : assessing the HUNTRESS trees with distance metrics under the SCITE generative model

* _mark02_ : investigate convergence of SCITE MCMC chains, given different initial points with tree distances.

* _mark03_ :  investigate convergence of SCITE MCMC chains, given different initial points with tree distances.

* _mark04_ :  assessing the HUNTRESS trees with distance metrics under the SCITE generative model.

* _mark05_ :  assessing the MCMC tree dispersion per tree-tree metric as a baseline to understand the tree-tree metric.

The outcome an analyis of the results is available in the [thesis](TODO: (gordonkoehn) add thesis here.).
